          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>We are two aspiring developers collaborating with CazeLabs to explore innovative methods of integrating OpenAI APIs. Our goal is to leverage artificial intelligence to enhance and streamline the educational experience for learners.</p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>Our mission is to make learning accessible and enjoyable for everyone. We believe in the power of conversation and the importance of personalized assistance in education. Our goal was to create a personalized virtual assitance for the students by using OpenAI APIs to train our AssignmentPAL model. We hope that this becomes a resource for students to get clarifications, feedback, and sources that are approved by their specific educational institution and relevant to their studies.</p>
